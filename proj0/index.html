  <p class="row-caption">When the selfie is taken up close, it makes features closer to the camera appear larger, 
    and those further away appear smaller. That is why the close up selfie has bigger noses and smaller ears.</p>

  <h3 class="section-header">Part 2: Architectural Perspective Compression</h3>
  <div class="image-row">

    </figure>
  </div>

    <p class="row-caption">Zooming on this outdoor image makes the background appear to have less definition, making objects in the background look compressed. 
        The second picture allows for more definition because it did not distort these perspectives.</p>

  <h3 class="section-header">Part 3: The Dolly Zoom</h3>
  <div>

      <figcaption>Dolly Zoom GIF created with a small cow figure</figcaption>
    </figure>
  <p class="row-caption">As the camera moves away and image is zoomed in, the image becomes more and more narrow.
    The background appears to be moving closer to the cow, while the cow remains the same size.
